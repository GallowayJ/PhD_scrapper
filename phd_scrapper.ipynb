        " u'<html>\\n <body>\\n  <p>\\n   High-throughput screening of stem cells is instrumental for biological research and discovery of new drugs. However, current methods for high-throughput cell screenings are limited and expensive. Screening of single cells is especially challenging.\\n   <br/>\\n   Recently we demonstrated that superhydrophobic-superhydrophilic microarrays can be used to create ultra high-density patterns of microdroplets (DropletMicroarrays). This method has the potential to become a new platform for ultra high-throughput screening of live cells and could allow hundreds of thousands of cell experiments to be performed in parallel using a single chip. Defined locations of isolated droplet microreservoirs on such chips will enable spatial indexing, time-lapse measurements and screening of single cells.\\n   <br/>\\n   The goal of this PhD project is to exploit the ability to perform ultra high-throughput screening of single cells in thousands of droplet microreservoirs. A range of important biological questions can be tackled using this novel technology. Therefore, creativity, scientific excellence, the ability to work in a highly interdisciplinary team will be the main qualities for a candidate for this position.\\n   <br/>\\n   We are looking for innovative, determined and ambitious students with many ideas. Once accepted in the group, the candidate will get access to all necessary equipment and consumables to work on the project. Office and lab space as well as access to the excellent infrastructure of the KIT will be provided. In addition, all students will be enrolled in the International Biointerfaces Graduate School at the KIT.\\n   <br/>\\n   Applications (CV and a cover letter explaining why you qualify for this project) should be sent to info@levkingroup.com indicating \\u201cPhD-cell screening\\u201d in the subject.\\n   <br/>\\n   www.levkingroup.com\\n  </p>\\n </body>\\n</html>',\n",

However, current methods for high-throughput cell screenings are limited and expensive. Screening of single cells is especially challenging.\\n   <br/>\\n   Recently we demonstrated that superhydrophobic-superhydrophilic microarrays can be used to create ultra high-density patterns of microdroplets (DropletMicroarrays). This method has the potential to become a new platform for ultra high-throughput screening of live cells and could allow hundreds of thousands of cell experiments to be performed in parallel using a single chip. Defined locations of isolated droplet microreservoirs on such chips will enable spatial indexing, time-lapse measurements and screening of single cells.\\n   <br/>\\n   The goal of this PhD project is to exploit the ability to perform ultra high-throughput screening of single cells in thousands of droplet microreservoirs. A range of important biological questions can be tackled using this novel technology. Therefore, creativity, scientific excellence, the ability to work in a highly interdisciplinary team will be the main qualities for a candidate for this position.\\n   <br/>\\n   We are looking for innovative, determined and ambitious students with many ideas. Once accepted in the group, the candidate will get access to all necessary equipment and consumables to work on the project. Office and lab space as well as access to the excellent infrastructure of the KIT will be provided. In addition, all students will be enrolled in the International Biointerfaces Graduate School at the KIT.\\n   <br/>\\n   Applications (CV and a cover letter explaining why you qualify for this project) should be sent to info@levkingroup.com indicating \\u201cPhD-cell screening\\u201d in the subject.\\n   <br/>\\n   www.levkingroup.com\\n  </p>\\n </body>\\n</html>', u'<html>\\n <body>\\n

COMIQ is a European Commission funded network focused at educating Early Stage Researchers (ESR) at the PhD level within a range of advanced cooling, trapping, and control techniques with the purpose of developing cold molecular ion research beyond its present state. The aim of COMIQ is to investigate and control a variety of molecular ion processes at the very quantum limit. COMIQ will work on establishing cold molecular ions as new quantum objects for applications in quantum technology, precision measurements, and controlled chemistry. The network is highly interdisciplinary, combining quantum optics, quantum information sciences, molecular physics, and chemical physics in a novel and original fashion. We therefore invite strong candidates from all relevant disciplines to apply for a fellowship.\\n   <br/>\\n   <br/>\\n   PhD research project\\n   <br/>\\n   The successful candidate will carry out experiments where a single, trapped ion is immersed into a Bose-Einstein condensate of neutral atoms. The goal of this PhD work is to study on the quantum level how to control chemical reactions of the ion and atoms and to create cold molecular ions in well-defined quantum states. Obtaining the full quantum mechanical control over a chemical reaction holds a key for future applications in quantum information technology, quantum chemistry and complex quantum dynamics. The position also offers exchange between members of the international training network and attendance at workshops. Further information on the research of the group and the project are available at the Hecker Denschlag group website and the COMIQ website.\\n   <br/>\\n   <br/>\\n   Eligibility Criteria\\n   <br/>\\n   The positions are open to all nationalities. The candidate may already have up to 4 years of research experience after obtaining the Masters degree. The researcher must not have resided or carried out his/her main activity (work, studies, etc.) in Germany for more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately prior to his/her recruitment. Short stays, such as holidays, are not taken into account.\\n  </p>\\n </body>\\n</html>', u'<html>\\n <body>\\n  <table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" summary=\"Required Research Experiences\">\\n   <caption>\\n    Required Research Experiences\\n   </caption>\\n   <tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n     <th class=\"fixSize\" scope=\"row\">\\n      Main Research Field\\n     </th>\\n     <td>\\n      Physics\\n     </td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n     <th class=\"fixSize\" scope=\"row\">\\n      Sub Research Field\\n     </th>\\n     <td>\\n      Optics\\n     </td>\\n    </tr>\\n   </tbody>\\n  </table>\\n </body>\\n</html>', u'<html>\\n <body>\\n  <table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" summary=\"Required Languages\">\\n   <caption>\\n    Required Languages\\n   </caption>\\n   <tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n     <th class=\"fixSize\" scope=\"row\">\\n      Language\\n     </th>\\n     <td>\\n      ENGLISH\\n     </td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n     <th class=\"fixSize\" scope=\"row\">\\n      Language Level\\n     </th>\\n     <td>\\n      Good\\n     </td>\\n    </tr>\\n   </tbody>\\n  </table>\\n </body>\\n</html>', u'<html>\\n <body>\\n  <table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" summary=\"Required Languages\">\\n   <caption>\\n    Required Languages\\n   </caption>\\n   <tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n     <th class=\"fixSize\" scope=\"row\">\\n      Language\\n     </th>\\n     <td>\\n      ENGLISH\\n     </td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n     <th class=\"fixSize\" scope=\"row\">\\n      Language Level\\n     </th>\\n     <td>\\n      Good\\n     </td>\\n    </tr>\\n   </tbody>\\n  </table>\\n </body>\\n</html>', u'<html>\\n <body>\\n  <table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" summary=\"Required Languages\">\\n   <caption>\\n    Required Languages\\n   </caption>\\n   <tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n     <th class=\"fixSize\" scope=\"row\">\\n      Language\\n     </th>\\n     <td>\\n      ENGLISH\\n     </td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n     <th class=\"fixSize\" scope=\"row\">\\n      Language Level\\n     </th>\\n     <td>\\n      Good\\n     </td>\\n    </tr>\\n   </tbody>\\n  </table>\\n </body>\\n</html>']\n"

        "<p>High-throughput screening of stem cells is instrumental for biological research and discovery of new drugs. However, current methods for high-throughput cell screenings are limited and expensive. Screening of single cells is especially challenging.   <br/>\n",
        "Recently we demonstrated that superhydrophobic-superhydrophilic microarrays can be used to create ultra high-density patterns of microdroplets (DropletMicroarrays). This method has the potential to become a new platform for ultra high-throughput screening of live cells and could allow hundreds of thousands of cell experiments to be performed in parallel using a single chip. Defined locations of isolated droplet microreservoirs on such chips will enable spatial indexing, time-lapse measurements and screening of single cells.<br/>\n",
        "The goal of this PhD project is to exploit the ability to perform ultra high-throughput screening of single cells in thousands of droplet microreservoirs. A range of important biological questions can be tackled using this novel technology. Therefore, creativity, scientific excellence, the ability to work in a highly interdisciplinary team will be the main qualities for a candidate for this position.<br/>\n",
        "We are looking for innovative, determined and ambitious students with many ideas. Once accepted in the group, the candidate will get access to all necessary equipment and consumables to work on the project. Office and lab space as well as access to the excellent infrastructure of the KIT will be provided. In addition, all students will be enrolled in the International Biointerfaces Graduate School at the KIT.                              <br/>\n",
